# RG Wealth - Ultra

> "The ultimate offline wealth dashboard. Zero servers, zero lag, 100% glassmorphism."

## The "Full Disclosure" (Don't Cancel Us)

Let's be real for a second. **We did not write this code.**

We are the **Architects**. We are the **Product Designers**. We are the **Chief Vibe Officers**.
But the actual syntax? The confusing JavaScript logic? The PWA service workers?

**That was all AI.**

We basically bullied a Large Language Model (Gemini) into becoming our Senior Full Stack Developer. We told it *exactly* what we wanted, how it should look, and how it should feel. It did the typing, we did the thinking.

## What is this?

This is **RG Wealth**. It's a personal finance tracker that lives on your phone but doesn't steal your data.

Most finance apps are ugly, slow, or try to sell you credit cards.
We wanted something that looks like it belongs in 2030, feels like an iOS app, and runs faster than our motivation on a Monday morning.

## The Flex (Features)

* **Glassmorphism Everywhere:** If it doesn't look like frosted glass, we don't want it.
* **PWA / Installable:** You can add this to your home screen. It removes the URL bar. It looks like a real app. It *is* a real app.
* **Offline First:** It works without internet. It caches everything. It runs on pure magic (and localStorage).
* **Local Notifications:** It yells at you when you spend too much or forget to backup.
* **Privacy Max:** **Zero servers.** **Zero database.** Your financial data lives on *your* device. If you clear your cache, you go broke (digitally).
* **Sexy Charts:** Pie charts that actually look edible.

## The "Stack" (If you can call it that)

We went **Vanilla**. No React, no Vue, no 500MB node_modules folder.

* **HTML5:** The skeleton.
* **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** Because writing custom CSS is pain.
* **Vanilla JS:** The brain.
* **FontAwesome:** For the icons.
* **Chart.js:** For the pretty circles.

## How to Use

1. **Open the link:** (WEBSITE LINK)
2. **Install it:**
* **Android:** Tap "Add to Home Screen" when it pops up.
* **iOS:** Tap Share -> "Add to Home Screen".


3. **Setup:** Create a password (it's local, don't forget it).
4. **Get Rich:** (Actual results may vary).

## Known Bugs

* There are no bugs, only "unexpected features."
* If something breaks, just refresh.
* If you lose your data because you didn't backup... that's a user error, bestie.
